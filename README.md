As far as I can tell, no additional instructions are needed to run this code!
(Besides the instructions in the base assignment)

Some AI (ChatGPT) was used for debugging (such as why some TCP errors were occuring), but I mostly used man pages and other online resources such as Beej's guide
for figuring out the needed logic, and all code was written by me.
